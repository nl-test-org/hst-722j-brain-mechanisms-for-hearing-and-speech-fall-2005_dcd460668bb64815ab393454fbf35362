Who should take this course?
----------------------------

Anyone interested in deepening their understanding of the role of the brain in speech and hearing. For students in the Harvard-MIT Speech and Hearing Bioscience and Technology Program, the course is an elective normally taken after the core courses HST.723 - Neural Coding and Perception of Sound, HST.718 - Anatomy of Speech and Hearing and 6.541J / HST.710J - Speech Communication. It is also appropriate for students in Brain and Cognitive Sciences or other departments who have a strong background in the neuroanatomy and neurophysiology of sensory and motor systems. Students unsure of their background should consult one of the instructors.

How does the course work?
-------------------------

Much of the learning is done by **topic discussions** of scientific papers. Typically, a topic begins with a lecture giving an overview of the topic. Then, 3-6 topic papers are read and discussed in class under the leadership of a student. Two of the topics are proposed by students and selected by a competitive process.

Grade and Assignments
---------------------

Your grade will be based approximately on the following:

| ACTIVITIES | PERCENTAGES |
| --- | --- |
| Paper Presentations, Discussion Leading and Class Participation | 65% |
| Written Topic Proposal and Oral Topic Presentation | 35%
